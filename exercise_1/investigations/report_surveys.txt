The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between AVG_SCORE (based on Effective Care & Readmission Rates) and SURVEY_SCORE is 0.22, which is a medium-sized effect. This suggests that there is a medium-sized positive relationship between survey results and official ratings; however, this is not a completely deterministic relationship. As is obvious from the below table, some top hospitals did not receive excellent survey results.

Also, notice that survey data is not available for our top hospitals; only survey data from 8/2015 was used, and we did an inner join.

Note: pcorr was computed by submitting the following Hive query: SELECT CORR(AVG_SCORE,SURVEY_SCORE) as PCORR FROM SURVEY_CORR;
